## About The Project

MedKIT or Media Toolkit is project that was developed as a school project, but because I need to reliably download and convert media files, I made it pretty advanced with lots of features for beginners and advanced users. 

MedKIT is delivered as ONE .exe. With that one file you can download YouTube video and convert it right away or just convert some media file which you have already on your PC. 
### Built With

This project is made in Python with help of yt-dlp and ffmpeg.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
## Getting Started

To start using MedKIT you just need to install FFmpeg see Prerequisites section. Else is handled by the executable.
### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- Install FFmpeg using winget on Windows
  ```cmd
  winget install "FFmpeg (Essentials Build)"
  ```
## Usage

You can use MedKIT by just opening the executable and confirming Windows security popup or you can open terminal in directory where MedKIT is located and running the executable from there, this might be helpful if MedKIT is crashing alot.
## Roadmap

- [ ] Add playlist support for videos
- [ ] Use GPU encoding for converting, since it doesn't work now

See the [open issues](https://github.com/NotJohnAfterAll/MedKIT/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
